== Creating a Spring Boot and Angular Application

This document details how to create an application that uses Spring Boot as the back end and Angular as the front end.
It is based on Dave Syer's sample, which you can find https://github.com/dsyer/spring-boot-angular[here].

=== Creating the Spring Boot Application

To create a Spring Boot application:

. Go to https://start.spring.io[the Spring Initializr].
. Specify the group ID that suits you.
We left it at `com.example`.
. Specify the artifact ID that suits you.
We used `spring-angular` for this example.
. Add the Spring Web dependency.
The following image shows the Spring Initializr with the settings we used:
image::initializr-angular.png[]
. Click Generate.

NOTE: We use Maven throughout this example.
You could also choose Gradle, but we do not cover that option.

=== Installing NPM Locally

To avoid collisions with other versions of NPM that we may have installed elsewhere, we modify the `pom.xml` file to install a local copy of NPM.
To do so, replace the `<build>` element in the `pom.xml` file with the following `<build>` element:

====
[source,xml]
----
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    </plugin>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>com.github.eirslett</groupId>
      <artifactId>frontend-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>1.6</version>
      <configuration>
        <nodeVersion>v9.11.2</nodeVersion>
      </configuration>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <id>install-npm</id>
          <goals>
            <goal>install-node-and-npm</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
----
====

Once you have modified the `pom.xml` file, run the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw generate-resources
----
====

You can verify that it worked by listing the contents of the node directory, as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
ls node*
----
====

You should see a file named `node` and a directory named `node-modules`.
You now have a local copy of NPM.

=== Installing the Angular CLI

You can continue to use the terminal to install the Angular command-line interface (CLI).
To do so, you should first create a local `npm` script (to avoid collisions with other `npm` commands).
The script should have the following content:

====
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/sh
cd $(dirname $0)
PATH="$PWD/node/":$PATH
node "node/node_modules/npm/bin/npm-cli.js" "$@"
----
====

You need to make the `npm` script runnable, which you can do with the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
chmod +x npm
----
====

You need a file called `package.json`, which describes your Angular application.
To create it, run `npm init` and answer the prompts (you can accept the default for most of them).

Now you can run your `npm` script to install the Angular CLI, as follows:

====
[source,bash]
----
./npm install @angular/cli
----
====

Now that you the Angular CLI installed, you need to create a local version of the `ng` command, so that running `ng` cannot interfere with any other `ng` command that may be available.
The script should have the following content:

====
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/sh
cd $(dirname $0)
PATH="$PWD/node/":"$PWD":$PATH
node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng "$@"
----
====

You need to make the `npm` script runnable, which you can do with the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
chmod +x ng
----
====

You can check to make sure it works by running the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
./ng --version
----
====

=== Creating an Angular Application

Once you have the Angular CLI installed and working, you can create an Angular application.
To do so, run the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
./ng new client
----
====

When prompted whether to add routing, choose `y`.
When prompted which CSS scheme to use, choose `CSS` (the default).


Now you need to move the Angular application into the Spring Boot application.
However, you cannot directly copy the whole thing.
The following commands show how to move the various pieces to the right places:

====
[source,bash]
----
cat client/.gitignore >> .gitignore
rm -rf client/src/favicon.ico client/.gitignore client/.git
sed -i -e 's/node_/anode/' .gitignore
cp -rf client/* .
cp client/.??* .
rm -rf client
sed -i -e 's,dist/client,target/classes/static,' angular.json
----
====

Those commands discard the node modules that the CLI installed because we want the frontend plugin to do that work for us in an automated build.
We also edited the `angular.json` file (a bit like a `pom.xml` file for the Angular CLI app) to point the output from the Angular build to a location that is packaged in our JAR file.

=== Building

Now we need to modify the `pom.xml` file to install the modules used in our application.
To do so, edit the `pom.xml` file to include the following `<execution>` element:

====
[source,xml]
----
<execution>
  <id>npm-install</id>
  <goals>
    <goal>npm</goal>
  </goals>
</execution>
----
====

To install the modules, run the following command (again):

====
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw generate-resources
----
====

To verify that it worked, run the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
./ng --version
----
====

The versions may change from the previous run of that command, depending on whether NPM found newer versions of the various modules.

At this point, the tests work, which you can verify by running the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
./ng e2e
----
====

(`e2e` stands for "`end-to-end`").

To build the client application during the Maven build, add the following `<execution>` element to the `pom.xml` file:

====
[source,xml]
----
<execution>
  <id>npm-build</id>
  <goals>
    <goal>npm</goal>
  </goals>
  <configuration>
    <arguments>run-script build</arguments>
  </configuration>
</execution>
----

[TIP]
=====
You can continuously build by running the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
/ng build --watch
----
====
=====

=== Adding Bootstrap

Twitter Bootstrap can help to make the application more attractive.
To add it, run the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
./npm install bootstrap@3 jquery --save
----
====

You need to update `styles.css` to import the Bootstrap file, as follows:

====
[source,css]
----
@import "~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css";
----
====

=== Extending the Angular Application

Some basic features are included in the default scaffolding app, including the HTTP client, HTML forms support, and navigation using the router.
All of them are extremely well documented at https://angular.io[angular.io], and there are thousands of examples on the internet.

As an example, we can add an HTTP Client call and hook it up to a Spring `@RestController`.
In the frontend `app-root` component (in `app.component.html`) we can add some placeholders for dynamic content, as follows:

====
[source,javascript]
----
<div style="text-align:center"class="container">
  <h1>
    Welcome, {{title}}!
  </h1>
  <div class="container">
    <p>Id: <span>{{data.id}}</span></p>
    <p>Message: <span>{{data.content}}</span></p>
  </div>
</div>
----
====

Now we need a `data` object in the scope of the component, as follows (in `app.component.ts`):

====
[source,javascript]
----
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import {HttpClient} from '@angular/common/http';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'Demo';
  data = {};
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {
    http.get('resource').subscribe(data => this.data = data);
  }
}
----
====

Notice how the `AppComponent` has an `HttpClient` injected into its constructor.
In the module definition, we need to import the `HttpClientModule` as well, to enable the dependency injection, as follows (in `app.module.ts`):

====
[source,javascript]
----
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    HttpClientModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
----
====

In our Spring Boot application we need to service the /resource request and return an object with the right keys for the client, as follows (in `DemoApplication.java`):

====
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@Controller
public class DemoApplication {

  @GetMapping("/resource")
  @ResponseBody
  public Map<String, Object> home() {
    Map<String, Object> model = new HashMap<String, Object>();
    model.put("id", UUID.randomUUID().toString());
    model.put("content", "Hello World");
    return model;
  }

}
----
====

If you look at the source code in https://github.com/dsyer/spring-boot-angular[Github], you can also see that there is a test for the backend interaction in app.component.spec.ts (thanks to http://blog.ninja-squad.com/2017/07/17/http-client-module/[this Ninja Squad blog entry]).
The `pom.xml` file has been modified to run the Angular e2e tests at the same time as the Java tests.

=== Conclusion

We have created a Spring Boot application, added a simple HTTP endpoint to it, and then added a Angular front end to it.
The Angular app is self-contained, so anyone who knows the tools can work with it from its own directory.
The Spring Boot application folds the Angular assets into its build, and you can easily update and test the front end from a regular IDE by running the application in the usual way.
